    p. Within these pages you can find information about me, my projects. For the
      curious, see the <a href="https://github.com/jm-janzen/nfacer">project&nbsp;source</a>
      for this website.

    p. Originally I started this website I guess on a whim. I wanted to play about with
      <strong>go</strong> some more on my own, and a website rewrite seemed like
      the perfect excuse to do that.

    p. Other than that, I just love tinkering with new technologies, frameworks, etc.

    h2.content-subhead okay but for real

    p. I do have an actual personality beyond software development and being a diligent
      worker, it's just that maybe a <s>glorified business card</s> personal "brand" (ü§ÆÔ∏è)
      website might not be the best place for expressing that.

    p. So just know that the content of this website is my attempt at squaring the conflict
      described above, between the professional version of me and the more authentic, dynamic
      representation of myself. So that's your disclaimer: like everyone, I'm more than either
      of these personas.

    p. OK, good talk. Enjoy the rest of the website!
